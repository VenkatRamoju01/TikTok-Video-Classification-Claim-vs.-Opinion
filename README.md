# **TikTok Video Classification: Claim vs. Opinion**
### Problem Statement  
TikTok is one of the most popular social media platforms, where users can upload and share videos. However, with millions of videos being uploaded, there is a challenge in regulating content, especially when users report videos for containing misleading claims. Currently, TikTok moderators manually review these reports, which can lead to delays due to the sheer volume.

To address this, we need to develop a **predictive model** that can automatically classify videos as either containing a claim or an opinion.

### Goal  
The goal is to predict whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or an "opinion," so that TikTok can efficiently prioritize user reports, allowing moderators to focus on videos that are more likely to present potentially harmful claims. This reduces the burden on moderators and improves the platform’s content management system.

I have broken down the entire process into four stages: **Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Evaluate (PACE)**. The actions performed under each stage are as follows:

- **Plan** – Understanding the data within the problem/business context  
- **Analyze** – Conducting exploratory data analysis and visualizations  
- **Construct** – Comparing machine learning models  
- **Evaluate** – Interpreting the model, assessing its limitations, and providing recommendations
